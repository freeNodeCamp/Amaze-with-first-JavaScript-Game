If you have got this far, and your game is working, well done!

You have seen many basic ideas of JavaScript:

* Printing text to the Terminal
* Creating variables with `const` and `let`
* Working with strings of text
* Installing and using a Node package
* Using objects (such as `options`)
* Working with arrays and their zero-index counting system
* Using `true` and `false`
* How other values are treated as `true` or `false`
* Using `if () { } else { }` statements to choose a parentheses
* Using a `while` loop
* Using the debugger
* Doing simple Arithmetic (addition, subtraction, modulo)
* Creating random numbers
* Rounding numbers up or down to the nearest integer
* Exiting a script cleanly

You have also seen how the process of programming works:

* You create a mental image of what you are going to make
* You deal with one small problem at a time
* You test after each step that your code does what you expect it to
* You use a search engine to find answers to your questions
* You consult the documentation
* You run little tests, to check that you have understood
* You read error messages, to understand where your assumptions were wrong
* You enjoy taking on challenges
* You will be learning something new every day

## Most importantly...

**You have seen that it is possible to create something intriguing with only a little knowledge. You don't have to have years of experience to produce something that others will find valuable.**
