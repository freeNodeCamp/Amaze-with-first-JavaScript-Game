The "more elegant solution" given in the previous section is:

* Easier to read
* Easier to explain
* Easier to maintain

It's good to have code that works. It's better to keep your code well-organized. The process of tidying up code that is already working is called _refactoring_. You can read more about it [here](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/refactoring).

**During refactoring, you don't fix anything that is broken, you don't add any new features, you just simplify the structure.**

You should refactor your code regularly.
