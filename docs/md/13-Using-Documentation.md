<summary>An important part of development</summary>
As a developer, you are going to being reading a lot of documentation. If you look at the [home page for JavaScript on the Mozilla Developers Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference#built-ins), you'll see that there are hundreds of topics to be covered. Look at the scrollbar in the image below, to understand how much is hidden.

No developer on Earth knows more than a fraction of this by heart. No developer on Earth even _uses_ more than a fraction of all the possibilities available. As you will soon discover, you can do excellent work with only a few simple techniques.

Even when you have used a particular feature regularly, after a few days your brain will start to forget the details. You will need to look up the exact wording to use. And new tools and features appear regularly, so there will always be something new to learn that did not exist until recently.

**Consulting documentation is an important part of development.**
