When you play the game, you get caught up in it. (At least, I hope you do.) But in order to create such a game, you have to step back and think, in detail, about what moving parts it needs, and how to make them move. So here's a list of some of the things that you may have noticed, without realising it.

## Things that the game can do

1. The game uses text.
2. Some of the text is fixed.
3. Some of the text is dynamic. It changes a little depending on the circumstances.
4. Some of the text sometimes disappears.
5. The game uses numbers.
6. The numbers can be random, like the initial length of the nail.
7. The game asks you to make choices, and it asks you to type a number or a letter to represent your choice.
8. The game can make its own choices: what text to show next, what move the computer should make, 
9. The game seems to use subtraction, because the nail gets shorter after each turn.
10. The game uses repetition. You play, the computer plays, you play again, ...
11. The game makes calculations, so that the computer can win.
12. The game knows when the game is over.
13. In another kind of repetition, the game can start over from the begininning.

<summary>Yes, but _how_...?</summary>
You can turn each of the statements above into a question. "**How does** the game use text?", "**How does** the game make its own choices?", "**How does** the game know that the game is over?"


If you already have some knowledge of JavaScript, read the list above again, and see if you can imagine how to deal with each of these items.

You can think of this guide as a TV serial. These are the plot points that will keep you in suspense until the final episode, when all is revealed.
