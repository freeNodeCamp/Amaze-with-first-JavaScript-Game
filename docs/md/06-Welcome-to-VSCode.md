NodeJS is not an application that you can open like a browser or social media app. It does not have a desktop icon you can click on or a  Graphic User Interface (or GUI) where you can point and click with your mouse. Instead, you have to control NodeJS from a Terminal.

The best place to find a Terminal is in VS Code. VS Code does have a GUI.

## Choosing a colour scheme

When you first launch VS Code, it asks you to choose your what colours to use for the interface. As a developer, you are going to be looking at your computer screen a lot, so it's good to be able to choose colours that you find clear and well-contrasted. Most developers choose a dark background with light text, as this is easier on the eyes.

For now, perhaps you will be happy with the default colour scheme. You can always make a different choice later. Click on the Welcome link to hide the Getting Started page.

## The Welcome Page

The Welcome Page invites you to explore the possibilities of the app through mini slide shows.

You can find these guides and more, later, through the Help menu. I suggest that you deselect the Show Welcome Page On Startup checkbox at the bottom of the page, so it won't keep coming back.

<summary>Getting started</summary>
To get started, you should create:

* A folder to hold all your future coding projects
* A second folder inside this first folder for the game you are about to create
* A file called `main.js` where you will write your code.
