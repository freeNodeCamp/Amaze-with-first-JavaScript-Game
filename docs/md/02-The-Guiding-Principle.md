There are two ways that I could write this article:

1. As a recipe
2. As a guide

If I wrote it as a recipe, I would give step-by-step instructions that you could follow without thinking. At the end (and very quickly) you would have a game that works and amazes your friends, but all you would have learned would be _how to follow instructions_.

I'm not going to do that.

Remember: theres's 10 days' worth of course material here for you to work through. It's worth making an effort.

I choose to write this article as a guide. That means both "as someone who has already travelled this path" and "as a description of what you will see along the way, and what to look out for." As a result:

* Sometimes, I will lead you down a little side-path, to explore something interesting
* Sometimes, I will go in the wrong direction and there will be an unexpected difficulty that you will need to deal with
* Sometimes, I will ask you to make predictions about what you think will happen next (and you may be wrong)
* Sometimes, I will ask you to use an idea that you have just learnt to solve a new problem on your own
* Sometimes, I will ask a question but I won't answer it immediately, so that when you see the answer, you will feel a sense of enlightenment.

My hope is that, at the end, you will have understood all the details of what you have done, well enough to be able to explain to someone else how to create this game, and how to fix their mistakes. In other words, at the end, I hope you will have _mastered_ these basic JavaScript techniques, and not just used them.

Perhaps this can be your guiding principle: if you can teach others, then it shows that you have really learnt something. Perhaps this is what will truly amaze your friends.
