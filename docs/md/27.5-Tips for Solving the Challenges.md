As you saw in the last section [27. Redrawing the Nail](#redrawing-the-nail), each challenge has three parts:

1. The task to complete
2. Hints on how to think about solving it
3. The complete code of the game with the solution included

The changes are just a few lines each time, but they might be in different places in the code.

### You won't learn much if you simply copy and paste the (changed lines of) code.

If you get stuck, a better approach is to:

* Study the changed lines of code in the Solution
* Hide the solution
* Edit your own code from memory

If you understand how the changed lines work, it should be easy to reproduce them.

### If you don't understand the changed lines, do some research.

There are different ways to do this:

1. In your browser, create a query for `js ...` followed by the keywords in the code that you don't understand
2. Add a breakpoint to your code, open your debugger and step through the code line by line
   * Watch how the value of variables change in the VARIABLES panel
   * Use the WATCH pane to check the value of longer expressions
   * Check which path your code takes through an `if ... else ...` statement
   * Check if the value of the expression in any `while (expression) { ... }` statements is still true

### If you think you have correctly altered your code, but it doesn't work as expected, compare your code with mine.

1. Open the Solution
2. Use the Copy button at the top left of a code listing to copy the complete code

3. Open your `main.js` file in VS code
4. Press the `F1` key on your keyboard (or `Ctrl-Shift-P`) to open the Command Palette
5. Start typing the beginning of the text `Compare Active File with Clipboard`

6. A new document will open called `Clipboard â‡” main.js`. Depending on the width your VS Code window, the differences may be shown inline...

   ... or side-by-side:

### Embrace your mistakes

If you get everything right the first time, then your brain has not had to work very hard, so it's not going to make the effort to remember. 

If you make a mistake, you will feel some kind of emotion. Your memory is triggered by emotions. After you fix the mistake, your memory will store your experience for later, so that you can avoid these emotions later.

In other words: making mistakes is one of the keys to learning.
