You can find the documentation for the `readline-sync` package [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/readline-sync). Take your time to read it. And as you are reading it, try the examples for yourself, as described below.

There is nothing that I can tell you about the `readline-sync` package that I did not find in this documentation page, so you can learn about it exactly the same way that I did.

<summary>Micro projects in a sandbox</summary>
When I am working on a big project and I need to learn a new technique, I:

* Stop working on the big project
* Create a separate micro project, where I can:
  * Build a proof-of-concept
  * Make experiments
  * Make mistakes
  * Test ideas
  * Develop my understanding
  * Build a working template that I can import into my big project
  * Write up comprehensive notes for future-me

Whenever you see a sand-coloured box like this, you'll get the chance to do something similar.

1. Open a new Terminal

![Use Terminal > New Terminal, or click the + button to create a new Terminal](images/newTerminal.webp)

2. Assuming that your Terminal is open on the parent directory (`My Learning Journey`), you can run:

```tex-w
code Nail_It/Tests/readline-sync/index.js
```
The `code` at the beginning of the command refers to VS Code. This line tells VS Code to create a file called `index.js` at the location given. You will see a new editor tab open, with the name `index.js â€¢`. The big round dot means "this file has not been saved yet", so you need one more step to bring it into existence.

![The `code` command will open a new tab in the text editor](images/newFile.webp)

3. Save the empty file

VS Code will now create all the intervening folders and the `index.js` file itself.

![VS Code creates all the folders when it saves the `index.js` file](images/savedFile.webp)

4. Run the command:

```tex-w
cd Nail_It/Tests/readline-sync 
```

This will [`c`hange the `d`irectory](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/open-reproducible-science/bash/bash-commands-to-manage-directories-files/#change-current-working-directory-cd) so that this new Terminal window will now be active in the new `readline-sync` directory.

![Use `cd` to change directory](images/cdToNewDir.webp)

5. Visit the [readline-sync documentation page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/readline-sync)
6. Copy the code that is given for the first "Simple case" (slightly edited below):

```javascript
const readlineSync = require('readline-sync');
 
// Wait for user's response.
const userName = readlineSync.question ('What is your name? ');
console.log('Hi ' + userName + '!');
 
// Handle secret text (e.g. password).
const favFood = readlineSync.question (
  'What is your favorite food? ',
  { hideEchoBack: true } // shows `*` instead of typed text.
);
console.log('Oh, ' + userName + ' loves ' + favFood + '!');
```

<summary>var</summary>
The original documentation uses `var` to declare a variable name.

The `const` and `let` keywords were added in 2016, and they do a much better job than `var`, which is now outdated. You will see `var` only in older projects, and in certain very specific cases where a variable may be re-declared.

You can learn more about `var`, `const` and `let` in [this freeCodeCamp article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/var-let-and-const-whats-the-difference/).

7. Paste this code into your file at `Nail_It/Tests/readline-sync/index.js`
8. Run the command:

```tex-w
node index.js
```

9. Answer the questions that you are given. Notice that you have to press Enter at the end of each answer.

10. Now the playful part:
    * Edit the code in `index.js` so that you see different questions when you run `node index.js`.
    * After each change, and before you run `node index.js`, see if you can predict what will happen.
    * Pay attention to where spaces are needed.
    * See if you can understand how the `+` operator works when it is placed between two strings. (You'll see this in more detail later.)
    * See what happens (if anything) when you change single quotes (`'`) to double quotes (`"`). What happens if you use one of each for the same string?
    * What happens if you use `hideEchoBack: false`?
  
<details class="note" open>
<summary>The options object</summary>

Notice how `hideEchoBack` is written inside curly braces (`{ ... }`). This structure generates an _object_ which has key-value pairs. Here's another object to illustrate this:

```javascript-#
{ key: "value", anotherKey: "another value", "a third key": 3 }
```

There are rules about how the names of the keys can be formed. They are similar to the rules for variable names. However, you can create a key name with any character in it, if you enclosed the key name with quotation marks.

Take your time. Have fun. Move on to the next section when you are ready.
