  <h2><a href="#setting-up-your-development-environment"> Setting up your Development Environment</a></h2>
  
First, you need to set up a Development Environment. You need:

1. A way to run JavaScript or NodeJS scripts on your computer
2. A code editor which will give you plenty of tools for writing JavaScript.

If you already have Node and VS Code installed, you can [skip this section and the next](#a-first-javascript-file).

## Install NVM, NodeJS and npm

The most comfortable way to install an application that will run JavaScript files on your computer is to install a program called Node Version Manager, or NVM for short.

Here is an [excellent article on freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/) which explains how to do just that.

<summary>Typing commands... where?</summary>
The article above asks you to type commands like `nvm -v`. Perhaps you have a question:

**"*Where exactly* do I type these commands?"**

The answer is: "In a Terminal window".

And the answer to your next question is: "Install Microsoft Virtual Studio Code first, as explained below, and VS Code (as it is called, for short) will provide you with an integrated Terminal window."

As for the answer to your question: **"Why didn't you tell me this *before* you gave the link for installing Node?"**

### The punchline before the joke

If you hear the punchline of a joke, but you didn’t hear the build up to the punchline, the joke is not funny. You feel nothing. For example, here’s a punchline:

> A woolly jumper

If you hear the build-up first (“What do you get if you cross a sheep with a kangaroo?”) then you start with a problem. When you hear the punchline/solution, you feel some kind of emotion. And emotions trigger your brain to remember.

Your brain wants you to remember how to repeat (or avoid) this kind of emotion in the future. Telling a joke well means giving the audience just enough time to feel uncomfortable about the problem the joke poses, before giving the key to resolving it.

As you work your way through this guide, you'll see that I have done my best to help troubleshoot any problems that might arise. But if a problem doesn't arise for you, you don't want to be bothered with Too Much Information about what might have gone wrong. And when it does arise, it helps to think about it first, before someone feeds you the answer.

In the future, if you run into difficulties, look a little ahead for a header with a disclosure button, like the one below. Open it up to find troubleshooting suggestions.

And just for fun, here’s another punchline. Think about it for a moment before you look at the whole joke.

In the future, if you run into difficulties, look a little ahead for an bright orange band with a lifebuoy logo, like the one at the top of this panel. Normally, it will be closed, because I hope that you do not often have problems. Open it up to find troubleshooting suggestions.

## Install Microsoft Virtual Studio Code

Virtual Studio Code (or VS Code, for short) is a free code editor with many powerful tools that are either built-in or are availble as free extensions.

You can follow the [instructions to install VS Code for your operating system](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), and enjoy all the hard work that other developers have contributed to make your experience of writing code so easy.

<summary>A Terminal for installing Node?</summary>
If you need a Terminal for [installing Node](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/), you can use [VS Code's integrated Terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics).

Indeed, the game you are going to create will be run from VS Code's integrated Terminal, so you will be spending a lot of time working with it.
